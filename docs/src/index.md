# WaterWaves1D.jl



## Overview

`WaterWaves1D` provides a framework to study and compare several models for the propagation of unidimensional surface gravity waves (a.k.a. "water waves").

Several models are already implemented, included ([but not limited to](https://waterwavesmodels.github.io/WaterWaves1D.jl/dev/basics/#models)) the so-called water waves system, its truncated spectral expansion, the Green-Naghdi system, the Matsuno system, and so on. You may easily add your favorite one to the gang: see the [how-to guide](https://waterwavesmodels.github.io/WaterWaves1D.jl/dev/howto) .
