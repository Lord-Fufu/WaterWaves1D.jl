# Background

## Water waves

While `WaterWaves1D` is dedicated to the propagation of unidimensional surface gravity waves (a.k.a. "water waves"), it provides a general framework and structures for numerically integrating initial-value problems

## Models

A description of the models as PDES, with a link to the desired section.

## Pseudospectral methods

All the systems described above are discretized (in the space variable) using the Fourier-based pseudospectral method. This method is particularly suitable for data which are either periodic or decaying at infinity, and fairly regular. In this framework one approaches data by a sum [...]
